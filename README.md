# futils

A few useful frontend utilities or `futils`, for short 🙃

> ⚠️ WARNING: This library is unreleased and a work in progress. Every release is at risk of having breaking changes, until its first major release.

## What is `futils`?

This library was inspired by frontend engineers, trying to help other frontend engineers. This library is mean to provide:
1) Any frontend engineer with basic to advanced utilities, as needed.
2) a suite of utilities, with the ability to use just 1 (or many) without incurring library bloat within their app

Some may bawk... why not just use something like `lodash`? While `lodash` is an amazing library, it provides different helpers. `futils` doesn't offer common `javascript` utilities that help to shorten and optimize code. `futils` provides ***frontend*** utilities that don't really exist in a popular library.

## Why `futils`?

We are a small group of frontend engineers that have worked on large-scale projects at startups and in enterprise orgs... and have just repeatedly created the same utilities for each team. And we just got tired of doing it over and over.

## Overview

The utilities you can find here are grouped by frontend domain. Here's a list:

- browser (e.g. DOM, navigational, URL helpers)
- react
  - client
  - server
  - nextjs

> These are all in design and will be undergoing development soon.


## Scrap notes
- This is why we support unbarreled imports/packages.
