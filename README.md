# 🧰 @futil | Frontend Utilities

A "few useful frontend utilities" or `futils` for short 🙃

> ⚠️ WARNING: This library is a work in progress. Every release is at risk of

## What is `futil`?

This library was inspired by frontend engineers, trying to help other frontend
engineers. This library was created to provide any frontend engineer:

1. with utilities ranging from basic to advanced (as needed)
2. the ability to use just 1 utility - or many - without incurring nasty library
   bloat

<summary>Why not just use something like <code>lodash</code> or <code>lodash.get</code>?</summary>
While `lodash` is an amazing library, it provides different helpers; `lodash`
simply serves a different purpose. `futil` doesn't offer common `javascript`
utilities that help to shorten and optimize code. `futil` provides
**_frontend_** utilities that don't really exist in an existing popular library.
</details>

## Why `futil`?

We are a small group of frontend engineers that have worked on large-scale
projects at startups and in enterprise orgs... and have just repeatedly created
the same utilities for each team. And we just got tired of doing it over and
over.

## Overview

The utilities you can find here are grouped by frontend domain. Here's a list:

- browser (e.g. DOM, navigational, URL helpers)
- react
  - client
  - server
  - nextjs

> These are all in design and will be undergoing development soon.
