# futil

A few useful frontend utilities or `futil`, for short 🙃

## What is `futil`?

This library was inspired by frontend engineers, trying to help other frontend
engineers. This library is mean to provide:

1. any frontend engineer with utilities ranging from basic to advanced, as
   needed
2. the ability to use just 1 (or many) without incurring library bloat

Some may bawk... why not just use something like `lodash`?

While `lodash` is an amazing library, it provides different helpers; `lodash`
simply serves a different purpose. `futil` doesn't offer common `javascript`
utilities that help to shorten and optimize code. `futil` provides
**_frontend_** utilities that don't really exist in a popular library.

## Why `futil`?

We are a small group of frontend engineers that have worked on large-scale
projects at startups and in enterprise orgs... and have just repeatedly created
the same utilities for each team. And we just got tired of doing it over and
over.

## Overview

The utilities you can find here are grouped by frontend domain. Here's a list:

- browser (e.g. DOM, navigational, URL helpers)
- react
  - client
  - server
  - nextjs

> These are all in design and will be undergoing development soon.
