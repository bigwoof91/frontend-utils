# futils

A few useful frontend utilities or for short, "futils" üôÉ.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This library is a work in progress and every release until its first major release is at risk of having breaking changes.

## What is futils?

This library was inspired by frontend engineers, trying to help other frontend engineers. We wanted to provide any frontend engineer with basic and advanced utilities as needed. We wanted to provide a whole suite of utilities, without requiring an over-bloated library.

Some may bawk, why not just use something like `lodash`? While `lodash` is an amazing library, which we use ourselves, we aren't just offering common `javascript` utilities that help to shorten code. We are offering ***frontend*** utilities that don't really exist. We are a small group of frontend engineers that have worked on large-scale projects at startups and enterprise orgs and have just repeatedly created the same utilities for each app. And we just got tired of doing it!

The utilities you can find here are grouped by frontend domain. Here's a list:


- browser (includes DOM and navigational helpers)
- react
  - client
  - server
- 


## Scrap notes
- This is why we support unbarreled imports/packages.
